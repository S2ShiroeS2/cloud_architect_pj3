Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

The vulnerabilities.

1. VPC Security Groups allow all inbound and outbound traffic, which is against AWS' guideline.
2. The IAM policy violates the concept of least privilege by granting full access to resources.
3. On the EC2 instance, TCP port 5000 is accessible from the internet.
4. CloudTrail Trail is not specified.
5. There is no HTTP->HTTPS redirection in the Loadbalancer.

Recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. Only allow 80 and 443 in the Security Groups, and refer to the other security group for accessing AWS resources within the VPC.
2. Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
3. Set IAM policies to prevent root users from gaining access and to enforce MFA, as well as specified permissions.
4. On the EC2 instance, disable all non-essential ports
5. Create a CloudTrail that is stored on S3.
